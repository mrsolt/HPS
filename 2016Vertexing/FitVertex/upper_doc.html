    <h1> Optimum Interval Software</h1>

This site contains software for computing an upper limit given unknown
background.  It includes methods for combining multiple measurements,
each of which alone can have its upper limit computed with the optimum
interval method.  The software, with this web page, is in the 1.3 MB gzipped
tar file <a href="../Upper.tgz">Upper.tgz</a>, and the individual
files totalling 4.1 MB are linked below.  Once the tar file is downloaded it
can be unpacked with GNU tar via 'tar xzf Upper.tgz' to locally
mirror this site in subdirectory Upper.

<LI> <a href="CERN_Stuff.f"> CERN_Stuff.f:</a> Various CERNLIB mathematical
routines needed for the optimum interval, as modified from CERN's source
archives to avoid calling other cernlib routines.  See<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
2006_src.tar.gz in their <a href="http://cernlib.web.cern.ch/cernlib/download/2006_source/tar/">source archive.</a><br>
There were also modifications to prevent some warnings when compilation is done
with extra warning options turned on.  CERN, of course, is not responsible in
the unlikely eventuality that I introduced errors.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
With CERN_Stuff.f it's not necessary to have other CERN software on the
computer in order to compile optimum interval software because
compilation commands can include "CERN_Stuff.f".

<LI> <a href="testUpper.f">testUpper.f:</a> A sample program
demonstrating use of the upper limit software.  Near the beginning is an
example of the command for compiling and linking with CERNLIB software using
the f77=g77=GNU project Fortran 77 compiler.  The "methods" it tests are
described in arXiv:1105.2928, and are numbered as given in comments near
the beginning of <a href="Upper.f">Upper.f</a>.  This program is used to
verify by Monte Carlo that CL confidence level upper limit do, indeed,
have probability at least CL of being above the truth.  The Monte Carlo uses
CERNLIB routine RANLUX.

<LI> <a href="Upper.f">Upper.f:</a> Real Function
Upper(Method,CL,Nexp,Maxp1,Nevts,mu,FC,ICode)
returns the CL confidence level upper limit for a combination of one or
more measurements.  Method is the method used to combine measurements.
Method=0 is just a call to UpperLim, with only one measurement.
Nexp is the number of experiments, and the other parameters are described near
the beginning of Fortran file.

<LI> <a href="UpperLim.f">UpperLim.f:</a> Real Function
UpperLim(CL,If,N,FC,muB,FB,Iflag) returns the CL confidence level upper
limit on the expected number of events given that there
are N events observed in some range of, say, energy, E.
The events are assumed to be ordered from low to high E, with
FC(i) defined as the probability that for the assumed shape of the
event distribution of the process of interest a random event will have
lower E than the one the i'th event has.  The array FC should
be dimensioned from 0 to at least N+1 because UpperLim uses,
for convenience, FC(0)=0 and FC(N+1)=1.  If muB is zero, there is
no known background.  Otherwise muB is the expectation of the total
amount of known background within the experimental range and FB is
like FC, but for the probability distribution of the known background
instead of the process of interest.  If muB is non-zero, the program
returns an upper limit with the known background subtracted.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within the UpperLim routine
there is a parameter NMax=150000, which is the limit on the
allowed size of N.  Increase NMax if you expect N > 150000.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The routine uses
the optimum range in E with range in probability greater
than 0.0, .01, .02, .05, .10, .20, or .50, depending on the choice
of If=1,2,3,4,5, 6, or 7.  If should probably be set to 1.  For mu < 100
CL must be from 0.00001 to 0.99999, though if it gets close to those
limits, results might be inaccurate.  For mu > 100 0.8 < CL < 0.995.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
UpperLim calls ForCnMax, CnMax, y_vs_CLf, and CMaxinf, along with CERNLIB
routine RZERO.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Iflag is a status return.  None of the returns indicates failure
of the calculation of upper limit.  If the program has good
reason to conclude that it failed, it aborts.  But the status return
does give information a user might like to know.  See comment lines
near the beginning of the code for what the various status codes mean.
In particular, Iflag at least 256 tags the existence of an excluded range
separated from and below the absolute upper limit returned by the program.
This possibility should be insignificant unless there are just a few events.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp

UpperLim.f includes a common 
 <p>Common/Upperlimcom/EndPoints(2),Exclude_low(2)
<p>where EndPoints is Integer and Exclude_low is real.  EndPoints contains
the values of I in FC(I) for the endpoints of the optimum interval,
and Exclude_low contains the excluded range if Iflag is at least 256.
See comments in the program.

Example:  If a cross section sigma0 would lead on the average to
mu0 events in the experimental range, a 90 % confidence level
upper limit cross section is 
<p>sigma = (sigma0/mu0) x UpperLim(0.9,1,N,FC,0.,FB,Iflag).

<LI> <a href="CMaxinf.f">CMaxinf.f:</a> Real Function
CMaxinf(CL,If,mu) computes what the maximum C<sub>&#8734;</sub>
(defined in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2701">arXiv:0709.2701</a>)
must be for the optimum interval in order to have CL
confidence level exclusion of the assumed signal as being
too high.  "If" is as for Upperlim, and mu is the assumed
expectation value of the total number of events in the
signal.  The routine uses tables CMax.txt for low statistics, mu < 99.4843, and
CMaxf.txt for the high statistics case.

<LI> <a href="y_vs_CLf.f">y_vs_CLf.f:</a> Real Function
y_vs_CLf(CL,f,Istat) computes the "y" such that CL=C<sub>&#8734;</sub>(y,f).
See <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2701">arXiv:0709.2701</a>
for the meaning of "y", "f". and "C<sub>&#8734;</sub>".
See <a href="y_vs_CLf.f">y_vs_CLf.f</a> for the meaning of Istat, the status
code indicating the quality of the calculation.  Istat greater than 2 means
the computation failed.  The routine uses table y_vs_CLf.txt and
CERNLIB routine DGAUSN.  DGAUSN could be replaced by PPND16 from <a
href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/apstat/241"> the web </a> and
Applied Statistics, vol. 37, pp. 477-484, 1988.  DGAUSN is
probably not going to be called during normal use of UpperLim.f.

<LI> <a href="Cinf.f">Cinf.f:</a> Real function Cinf(y,f,Istat)
computes C<sub>&#8734;</sub>(y,f), with y and f as defined in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.2701">arXiv:0709.2701</a>.  Istat is a
return code described by comment lines near the beginning of 
<a href="Cinf.f">Cinf.f</a>.  Cinf uses table ymintable.txt.

<LI> <a href="ConfLev.f">ConfLev.f:</a> Real Function
ConfLev(m,x,mu,icode) calculates C<sub>m</sub>(x,mu), as described
in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0203002"> arXiv:physics/0203002</a>.
We require mu &#8804; 104.585 and m  &#8804; 100.  The return
code, icode, is described by comments
near the beginning of <a href="ConfLev.f">ConfLev.f</a>.  It calls CERNLIB
function GAMDIS.  It uses table Cm.txt.

<LI> <a href="CombConf.f">CombConf.f:</a> Real Function CombConf(Method,p1,p2,mua,mub,ICode)
is used by Upper.f.  It
gives the confidence level by which the cross section is rejected as too
high when it is rejected by two measurements with confidence levels p1 and
p2.  The two measurements have total expected number of events mu1 and mu2.
CombConf uses XC0 from C0.f.

<LI> <a href="C0.f">C0.f:</a> Real functions C0(x,mu) and dC0dx(x,mu), which
evaluate C<sub>0</sub> (defined in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0203002"> arXiv:physics/0203002</a>)
and its derivative, XC0(p,mu,ICode), which evaluates the value
of x for which C0(x,mu)=p, 
C0Int(A,B,mu1,mu2,z,Icode), which evaluates a certain integral defined in
terms of C0 and its derivative.  There are a couple other pieces of software
used in this file for dealing with the C0 function.  CERNLIB program RZERO
is used to evaluate XC0.  The routines in C0.f are used by CombConf, ConfLev,
and Upper.

<LI> <a href="CnMax.f">CnMax.f:</a> Real function CnMax(Mmax,f,mu,HighCut,fmin,mtop,Istat)
calculates the maximum interval C<sub>n</sub>.

<LI> <a href="CMaxf.txt">CMaxf.txt:</a> A table used by CMaxinf when
mu >99.4843.

<LI> <a href="y_vs_CLf.txt">y_vs_CLf.txt:</a> A table used by
y_vs_CLf.

<LI> <a href="Cm.txt">Cm.txt:</a> A table used by ConfLev.

<LI> <a href="ymintable.txt">ymintable.txt:</a> A table used by
Cinf.
