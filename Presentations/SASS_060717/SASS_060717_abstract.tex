    The Heavy Photon Search (HPS) experiment at Jefferson Lab is searching 
    for a new $U(1)$ vector boson (``heavy photon'', ``dark photon'' or $A'$)
    in the mass range of 20-500 MeV/c$^{2}$. An $A'$ in this mass range is
    theoretically favorable and may also mediate dark matter interactions.  
    The $A'$ couples to the ordinary photon through kinetic mixing, which 
    induces their coupling to electric charge. Since heavy photons couple to
    electrons, they can be produced through a process analogous to 
    bremsstrahlung, subsequently decaying to an $e^{+}e^{-}$, which can be
    observed as a narrow resonance above the dominant QED trident background.
    For suitably small couplings, heavy photons travel detectable distances
    before decaying, providing a second signature. Using the CEBAF electron
    beam at Jefferson Lab incident on a thin tungsten target, along with a 
    compact, large acceptance forward spectrometer consisting of a silicon
    vertex tracker and lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter, HPS is 
    accessing unexplored regions in the mass-coupling phase space. 

    This talk will present an overview of everything that is the HPS 
    experiment including the latest results and the future of HPS.
